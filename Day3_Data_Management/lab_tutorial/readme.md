# Data Asset Management Workshop

With your devices connected, your data starts to accumulate on EnOS. It could be quite a challenge to manage the vast amount of IoT data. Data Asset Management offering provides services that help you reduce your cost on data storage, lowers development barrier of stream analytics, and increases data access efficiency.

Before you dive into the offering, youâ€™ll want to get yourself familiar with the key concepts about stream data processing and data storage.

## Scenario

This workshop will walk you through the different paths of data flows on EnOS. Before you start, review the [real-time data flow](https://support.envisioniot.com/docs/data-asset/en/latest/learn/data_flow.html) after data is ingested through IoT Hub.

## Prerequisites

- You have signed up to EnOS for an individual account or an enterprise account to access the EnOS Console.
- Your account must been assigned full access to the model service, device connectivity & management service, and 
asset tree service.
