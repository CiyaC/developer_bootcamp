# Tutorial Overview

## Scenario

The first thing you start to do on an IoT platform is to connect your devices and data. This tutorial walks you 
through registering a smart device (smart battery) on the EnOS Cloud, performing device-end development, connecting the 
device to EnOS Cloud, and simulating data transmission through Java program. This tutorial is the basic learning module you need to complete first.

In the energy industry, monitoring the status of batteries during charging is common business scenario. Temperature 
is an important indicator of the battery status and safety. By connecting the smart battery devices into EnOS, you can ingest the real-time temperature data, configure alert settings to monitor the battery status, and control the state of the battery device.

The scenario is depicted in the following chart:

This tutorial walks you through registering a smart battery device on the EnOS Cloud, performing device-end development, connecting the device to EnOS Cloud, and simulating data transmission through Java program. In this tutorial, you will:

- Register a battery device on the EnOS Console
- Connect the battery device into EnOS Cloud
- Simulate the battery temperature data using a Java program developed through EnOS Device SDK
- Send command to the battery device to control its charging state
- Set alert rules to monitor the temperature of the battery device

## Prerequisites

- You have signed up to EnOS for an individual account or an enterprise account to access the EnOS Console.
- Your account must been assigned full access to the model service, device connectivity & management service, and 
asset tree service.
