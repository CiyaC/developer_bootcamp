This tutorial walks you through a typical path of smart battery management, that is:

- Registering & connecting a simulated Smart Battery into EnOS.
- Simulate the battery to post measuring points data using a Java program developed through Java SDK
- Monitoring the alerts of Smart Battery.


## Prerequisites

1. You have signed up to EnOS as an individual account or an enterprise account to access the **EnOS Console**.
2. Your account must have been assigned full access to the model service, device connectivity & management services, and data management services (in the training, this is already done by the trainer).
