# Device Connectivity & Management Workshop

The first thing you start to do on an IoT platform is to connect your devices and data. This tutorial is the basic learning module you need to complete first.

## Scenario

In the energy industry, monitoring the status of batteries during charging is common business scenario. Temperature is an important battery status and safety indicator. By connecting the smart battery devices to EnOS, you can ingest the real-time temperature data, configure alert settings to monitor the battery status, and control the state of the battery device.

The scenario is depicted in the following chart:

This tutorial walks you through a typical path of smart battery management, as per the below.

- Registering & connecting a Smart Battery to EnOS.
- Simulating the battery to post measurement points data using a Java program developed through Java SDK.
- Monitoring the alerts of the Smart Battery.

## Prerequisites

1. You have signed up for an individual account or an enterprise account to access the **EnOS Management Console**.
2. Your account must have been assigned full access to the model service, device connectivity & management services, and data management services (in the training, this is already done by the trainer).
